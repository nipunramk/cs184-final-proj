<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>In this project, we worked on the problem of generating compelling visualizations given an audio file.  </p>

<h2 align="middle">Audio Visualizations on a Simple Sphere Geometry</h2>
The first visualization we attempted to create was a simple sphere that would change size and color according to frequencies in the music. We used the three.js framework to render a scene with a sphere. Once we generated a scene, we then used a listener from the Web Audio API to analyze the frequency domain data from the audio file. The frequencies provided from the audio context were then averaged into a single value that was then used to scale the radius of the sphere. Additionally, we normalized this average frequency value to a value between 0 and 1 by dividing it by the maximum frequency found in the frequency domain. We then mapped this normalized value to a specific color over the hex color scale as defined by HTML5. Below is a screenshot of the main code that changes attributes of the sphere.

  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>

      </td>

  <table style="width=100%">

      <td>

        <figcaption align="middle">Sphere Mesh</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>


<h2 align="middle">Audio Visualizations on an Evenly Spaced Box Geometry</h2>

The previous visualization consolidated all of the audio information into one final average value. This seemed like a huge compression of information, so we decided to make use of more of the frequency bins. In this visualization, we created a scene with 60 box geometries, each with a height attribute that corresponds to the z-axis of the mesh. We then generated an array of frequency bins from our frequency domain calculation at each time step defined by an audio context for the audio file. We then traversed the array by the number of bars in our frequency bin and scaled the z-axis of the bar if the frequency value was large enough. Below is a code snippet that animates the various box geometries.

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<h2 align="middle">Audio Visualizations on a Sphere Mesh</h2>

This visualization tries to change the position of the vertices on a sphere's mesh in correspondence to the frequencies of the music. For the geometry, we decided to use a Geodesic polyhedron - a sphere created by subdividing an icosahedron. 
Like the other visualizers, this one uses the AudioContext interface to preprocess the audio file. It gets the frequency domain data of the audio file and splits them into two equally sized arrays: lower frequencies and higher frequencies. It then calculates the average frequency for both of these arrays. For every single vertex, it recalculates the position by first normalizing the vertex. It then feeds the vertex's position to the SimplexNoise API to randomly sample a noise from 3D. It calculates the distance each vertex will be displaced by summing the radius of the original sphere, the lower frequency average, and the noise multiplied by the higher frequency average. The vertex is multiplied by this scalar and the mesh updates accordingly by recalculating the vertex and face normals.

<h2 align="middle">Reflection on Progress</h2>

<p>Our main goal by this first milestone was to be able to successfully process the audio file and then use the audio file to alter various base geometries to create interesting visualizations. We achieved that goal and will continue to fine tune these geometric visualizations and add features. We will also explore using different audio features to generate visualizations and also explore looking at texture/landscape visualizations.</p>
